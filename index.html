    <section id="project-introduction">
      <h2>Project Introduction</h2>

      <p>In today’s musical world, the success of a song on streaming platforms like Spotify and YouTube isn’t 
        simply determined by melodies or marketing strategies. Musical elements play a crucial role in attracting
        audiences and influence their level of engagement; factors such as danceability, loudness, acousticness, 
        and various other musical attributes could be significant. Our project aims to examine what particular factors
        influence the success of various tracks on two popular streaming platforms, Spotify and YouTube, via metrics
        like streams (Spotify) and views and likes (YouTube).
      </p>

      <p>By analyzing this data, we can uncover insights on what truly resonates with audiences in the digital age. 
        This exploration not only offers a deeper understanding of the potential relationship between musical elements 
        and audience preferences but also provides guidance for artists, producers, and music professionals seeking 
        to navigate the ever-evolving scope of digital music distribution and consumption.

    <!-- Our Data -->
    <section id="our-data">
      <h2>Our Data</h2>

      <p>Our analysis is based on a dataset from Kaggle, a well-known platform for data scientists and other 
        developers to run machine learning competitions, write and share code, and host datasets. Our dataset 
        titled <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salvatorerastelli/spotify-and-youtube">Spotify and Youtube</a> 
        provides detailed statistics and metrics for the top 10 songs of various artists. It consists of 20,719 rows, 
        each row representing a unique song, and 26 features that detail the various attributes as presented by 
        Spotify and YouTube.
      </p> 
  
      <p>In terms of Spotify attributes, the dataset includes details such as the track name, artist, album details,
        and a unique Spotify URI for API access. It also includes audio feature information for each track, pulled 
        from <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-audio-features">Spotify's API</a>, 
        as well as song duration in milliseconds and the number of streams. 
      </p>
  
      <p>In terms of YouTube attributes, the dataset provides information like the video's URL, title, channel on which
        it was posted, view count, like count, comment count, and other descriptive details like whether it is licensed 
        and an official video.
      </p>

    <!-- Cleaning & Pre-Processing -->
    <section id="cleaning-preprocessing">
      <h2>Cleaning & Pre-Processing</h2>
      <p>Our dataset is relatively clean so our cleaning and pre-processing steps were minimal. We renamed a few of the 
        columns consisting of Spotify and YouTube metrics to include the platform names in order to better differentiate 
        between them (e.g. "views" -> "Views_YouTube"). We also decided to remove a few columns that would not be relevant/used 
        in our data visualization process, such as URLs, YouTube descriptions, and the YouTube channel names (since we already
        have the track and artist names from the Spotify columns). Additionally, despite some of the non-American artists having 
        accented characters in their names, the encoding issue head little effect on our data visualization process 
        since we are focusing on numerical data, like audio features and statistics. 
      </p>

    <!-- Overview of the relationship between a song's audio features and success -->
    <section id="audio-features-success">
      <h2>Overview of the relationship between a song's audio features and success</h2>

      <p>First, we can examine if there are any relationships between a song's audio features and its success on Spotify (measured 
        by number of streams) and YouTube (measured by number of views). We created an interactive facet grid of scatter plots using Altair
        to depict this. Each scatter plot shows the correlation between an audio feature of songs and their number of streams on Spotify.
        When we created this same scatter plot for YouTube views, it showed almost the same correlations, so we decided to only include one for brevity.
      </p>

      <p>To interact, you can click and highlight any part on one of these scatter plots to show the corresponding songs' data on 
        the other plots (multi-panel selection). Only the ones highlighted will be in green, while the nonhighlighted values will appear slightly transparent.
      </p>

      <div>
        <iframe src="visualizations/interactive_scatterplot.html" width="1080" height="600"></iframe>
     </div>

     <p>Based on these scatterplots, it is clear that artists' top songs on Spotify tend to have higher Danceability, Energy, Loudness,
      and Tempo, as well as lower Speechiness, Acousticness, Instrumentalness, and Liveness. In other words, songs that are more
      energetic, danceable, louder, have a tempo between 100-150 BPM, have fewer spoken words, acousticness, instrumentals, and not are not live versions
      are more likely to perform well in terms of streams. Meanwhile, Key and Valence do not seem to have as much of an effect
      on how songs perform on Spotify with most of the songs' points scattered across a large range. 
    </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Attributes of Top 5 Artists -->
    <section id="top-artists-attributes">
      <h2>What attributes do the Top 5 Artists on each platform possess?</h2>

      <p>Next, we wanted to see out of all of our artists' songs, who were the top artists and what audio features
        do their songs possess that make them the most successful? We created static radar charts, depicting the musical 
        attributes for the Top 5 Artists on each platform, Spotify and YouTube. We decided to omit some of the audio features 
        for this visualization, such as Key, Liveness, and Instrumentalness since they were either not on the same scale nor 
        as relevant/had very low values. Then, we normalized the remaining features.
      </p>

      <div>
        <img class="container" src = "visualizations/topspotify_radarchart.png" width="70%" height="950px" frameborder="0"></img>
      </div> 
      <br>
      <div>
        <img class="container" src = "visualizations/topyoutube_radarchart.png" width="70%" height="950px" frameborder="0"></img>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>The top artists vary on each platform, except for Ed Sheeran. Upon analyzing these radar charts, we see that high
        Loudness, Energy, and Danceability are factors that tend to correlate with greater success among these top artists, 
        whereas Speechiness and Acousticness are less desirable. As we saw in our previous scatter plots, Valence and Tempo do not 
        seem to correlate much with success at all, even among these top artists.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Danceability and Energy -->
    <section id="danceability-energy">
      <h2>What is the correlation between Danceability and Energy</h2>
      
      <p>Based on the previous visualizations, it is clear that danceability and energy are two of the most influential features on 
        a song's streaming success on either platform. We expected that a higher danceability score would mean a higher energy score for a particular song. 
        The following plot is an interactive bubble plot generated using Plotly Express,
        illustrating the relationship between the Danceability and Energy attributes of an artist's songs, with the size of the bubbles
        representing the average views on YouTube for each artist. This was created by aggregating our main dataset by artist name and 
        averaging all numerical attributes, pulling out Danceability, Energy, and YouTube views. 
      </p>

      <p>To interact with the bubble plot below, the user can zoom into specific sections of the plot for closer examination. Additionally,
        selecting a particular legend item filters the plot to display only the data points for that specific artist. Hovering over a bubble 
        reveals a tooltip containing the artist's name, exact danceability, and loudness (another influential audio feature) scores, as well 
        as YouTube views.
      </p>

      <div>
        <iframe src = "visualizations/bubbleplot.html" width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
      </div>

      <p>Upon observing the plot, it becomes apparent that danceability and energy generally exhibit a positive correlation. This suggests 
        that as the danceability score of an artist's songs increases, so does the energy score.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- YouTube Video Official/Licensed Impact -->
    <section id="youtube-impact">
      <h2>Does a song's YouTube video being official and licensed affect its success?</h2>

      <p> We wanted to figure out if a song's YouTube video being its official video and/or being licensed content
          affects its success (in YouTube views). This static side-by-side bar plot shows the relationship between Official
          and/or Licensing status and average YouTube views. We can conclude that official and licensed videos are much
          more successful, and a video that is both Official and Licensed achieving the highest average views compared
          to if a video is not official and/or not licensed. This makes sense with what we hypothesized since official,
          licensed videos are likely music videos for title songs with promotion efforts. 
      </p>

      <div>
        <img class="container" src = "visualizations/official_licensed_barchart.png"></img>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Album Type's Effect on Success -->
    <section id="album-effect">
      <h2>Observing Album Type's Effect on Success</h2>

      <p>Finally, we wanted to see if a song's Album Type (if it was released as part of an album, compilation, or just as a single) had any 
        correlation with audio features and in turn, streaming success. This static side-by-side bar chart compares Danceability, Energy, and Valence averages across 
        songs that are on Albums, Compilations, or are Singles. Singles have higher Danceability and Energy, indicating that singles that perform well are more tailored to be upbeat tracks. 
        Songs on compilations have the lowest Energy levels, while Valence shows minimal variation and Singles tend to be more positive. Overall, Singles are 
        more engaging and upbeat compared to songs on Albums and Compilations, catering to different audience preferences.
      </p>

    </section>

    <!-- Summary and Future Work -->
    <section id="summary-future-work">
      <h2>Summary and Future Work </h2>

      <p>In conclusion, we have found that there are certain attributes that artists should focus on for a better likelihood
        of success on music streaming platforms like Spotify and YouTube. These include Danceability, Energy, Loudness, and Tempo.
        There are also audio features that have little to no relationship with success and popularity such as Valence and Key. This 
        can be surprising to some, especially because we may think that a song being more positive/happy would equate to more success, especially
        in the mainstream market. 
      </p>

      <p>We have also found that other factors like whether a song's YouTube video is official and/or licensed as well matters as well for
        promotional reasons. Additionally, artists' top songs that are released as singles as opposed to being part of an album or
        compilation tend to have higher danceability and energy, which can be a learning lesson for other artists looking to create big hits. 
      </p>

      <p>Furthermore, we found that success trends between Spotify streams and YouTube views are very similar, so artists should
        make an active effort to promote their music on both platforms and not simply assume that one is better than the other
        for exposure or growth. 
      </p>

      <p>In terms of future work, there are a few other types of analysis that we think would have been interesting to explore
        given more time and access to data: 
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Genre-based analysis: </b>Find data that includes genres for these artists and their songs, and explore the correlation between
        genre and various audio features and/or streaming success and engagement.</li>
        <li><b>User enagement analysis: </b>Examine correlations between YouTube engagement metrics, such as likes, views, and comments.</li>
        <li><b>Predictive modeling: </b>Utilize machine learning algorithms in order to predict future streaming trends, popular genres, and/or 
        emerging artists. This could include gathering the audio features of a new song and predicting its level of success on music streaming platforms.</li>
      </ul>
